        Anime is one of my favorite things to watch and is a major reason why I
        love Japan. I think it is amazing the work that goes into creating such
        beautiful animations and building very creative worlds within a
        fictional story.

      <p>
        Who doesn't love gaming nowadays? I enjoy playing games on my main
        desktop and appreciate a wide range of genres, for example, RPG, Action,
        Adventure, and more. Games are a great way of entertainment and open the
        mind to relaxation and creativity.

        I love to make food such as tacos and salad bowls, but I also enjoy
        making drinks, especially coffee. This image shows a KitKat latte I
        made, and the second image shows some delicious cake truffles.
